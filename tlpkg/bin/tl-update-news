# NEWS and ChangeLog files are maintained with the sources; we want to
# copy almost all the NEWS, and ChangeLog if NEWS is not available, to
# the runtime. We install a few README files too.
# 
# This is run, by hand, during the release process, along with updating
# the man pages, Texinfo manuals, and more. See tlpkg/doc/releng.txt.
#
# pdftex, luatex, mpost, cweb and related, ptex and related;
#   the manuals are updated separately, not in this script,
#   but we update some of the NEWS here.
# 
# (By the way, we don't ordinarily use sh -e, but since all we're doing
# here is a bunch of copies, it seemed the simplest.)
