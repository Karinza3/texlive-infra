# This tiny script is used from ctan2tds as a specialinsrunner.
# 
# The problem is that a number of packages make it impossible to
# generate derived files (.sty) from their .dtx without also
# regenerating the documentation (.pdf).  Which we do not want to do,
# because remaking the doc generally involves many steps, external
# programs, and who knows what else.
# 
# Thus this script saves foo.pdf, runs pdflatex foo.tex, then restores
# foo.pdf.  That way we get the derived files but the author's .pdf.
# 
# Authors are sometimes responsive to supporting an alternate method for
# running the dtx that does not remake the doc (e.g., \ifpdf), but not
# always.  So we need this workaround.
# 
# With a first arg --engine, the second arg is the name of the program
# to invoke, instead of pdflatex.

if test x"$1" = x--engine; then
  shift
  engine=$1; shift
else
  engine=pdflatex

basefile=`echo "$1" | sed 's/\.[^.]*$//'`
mv "$basefile.pdf" save.pdf
yes y | head -100 | $engine "$@" # emisa: also asks for overwrite
